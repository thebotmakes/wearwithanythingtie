# wearwithanythingtie


Code for Flora colour changing tie - this code (and a bit of sewing) will allow you to create a fashion accessory that will go with any outfit in your (or your partner's) wardrobe.  Colour blind - not a problem!  Let electronics do the hard work for you!

Uses the Adafruit Flora system.  Colour sensor on the back to see what the background colour is, a Gemma to scale and output the colour (also on the back) and a singe Neopixel on the front to display the colour.  Note you could easily add more neopixels but because I wanted the Gemma and the sensor to be out of sight that made the path for sewing a bit tricky so I stuck with one.  Also - power comes from a LIPO battery attached to the Gemma.
